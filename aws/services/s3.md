# Simple Storage Service (S3)

* Inexpensive object storage
* Basically a key/value store
* Buckets span all AZs in a given region
* Durable to the loss of 2 AZs simultaneously
* Supports server side encryption (AES-256)
* Used to host static objects
* No true file system, but you can use file paths as keys to give the illusion
