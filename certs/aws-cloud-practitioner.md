# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

> Current as of late 2020.

## Overview

This is the introductory level certification for AWS - meant generally for managers, sales, purchasing, financial, and other less-technical roles.

Despite being a mostly non-technical exam I think that it is valuable for anyone who is just getting started with cloud technologies, including people in technical roles. It requires you to develop an understanding of the services provided by AWS and gives you a foundational introduction to cloud computing concepts.

Having some experience using AWS (at work, in a personal account, etc.) would be nice but not necessary. You should probably dedicate at least 5 hours to studying, and preferrably double that or more. Using a third party set of instruction materials (video course, study guide, etc.) is a good way to get a structured set of topics to focus on. The majority of test question materials cover things that are freely available in the official AWS service documentations.

## Exam topics

* AWS global infrastructure
* Architectural design principals
* AWS services - which to use for a given task, and why
* Security
* AWS pricing, billing, and account management
* General cloud computing concepts

## Study materials

* The AWS website
    * Service details
    * FAQs
* Official AWS documentation
    * May go into more depth than required for this exam
* Forums
    * Official AWS forums
    * StackOverflow
    * Quora
* [Official AWS Whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/) (may be excessive)
    * [Overview of Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html)
    * [Architecting for the Cloud: AWS Best Practices](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmedia/AWS_Cloud_Best_Practices.pdf)
    * [How AWS Pricing Works](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws_pricing_overview.pdf)
    * [The Total Cost of (Non) Ownership of Web Applications in the Cloud](https://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_TCO_Web_Applications.pdf)
    * [Compare AWS Support Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/)

Be careful when referencing third party study material - always check the date of publish. I used some materials that were nearly 3 years old, and about a third of the actual test material was not covered - many of the services having not existed when the study material was written. Cloud technologies tend to advance quickly so it would be wise to use the most recent content you can find.

## The exam

* $100
* Can be taken in person at a testing center, or through online providers:
    * Pearson Vue
    * PSI
* 100 minutes to complete
* About 65 multiple choice or multiple response questions
* Remote testing requires a webcam; you also need to show that no one else is in the room and nothing is on your desk besides a computer and mouse (not even a second monitor).
