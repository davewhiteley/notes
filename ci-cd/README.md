# CI/CD

Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment

## Continuous Integration

CI is the process of frequently integrating (merging) changes to a shared source code repository and/or shared branches of a repository. Depending on the amount of work happening in a repo, this may be multiple times per day for each contributor.

The goal of CI is to catch bugs and other issues quickly. Typical CI systems involve automated building and testing of the code before it can be merged into a shared branch. With contributors creating frequent, small changes it becomes easier to identify the source of a problem when it is first detected.

The opposite of CI would be to work on projects mostly in isolation, then as a release approaches you would be forced to hastily resolve an unknown quantity of merge conflicts, build issues, bugs, security vulnerabilities, etc.
